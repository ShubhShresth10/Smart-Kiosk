## Smart-Kiosk
A compact, modern Point-of-Sale (POS) system featuring a LattePanda Mu mini-PC, integrated thermal receipt printing, and a 10.5-inch touchscreen interface.

Purpose-
The core purpose of my Smart Kiosk project is to create a professional, subscription-free, and custom-designed Point-of-Sale (POS) solution for small retail businesses. Commercially available kiosks are often too expensive and force the user to adapt their workflow to the software. By building this system—integrating a powerful LattePanda Mu, a touchscreen, and a receipt printer into a custom 3D enclosure, I am providing a reliable, aesthetically pleasing alternative that gives a small business full control over their inventory, sales data, and physical hardware, all without recurring fees.
Since it is an open source project it will be very helpful to any Small businessman or shop owner who want to make their shops and business mode attractive To the customer and giving it a modern and futuristic touch.
